\# Deploying Netskope Private Access Publisher with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

This document will guide you how to deploy Netskope Private Access Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.

Netskope Private Access (NPA), a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution, seamlessly connects authenticated users anywhere, using any devices to private resources in data centers and public cloud environments. Built on the NewEdge security private cloud, NPA delivers fast and direct application connectivity, ensuring a superior user experience.

To learn more about Netskope Private Access please refer to the [Netskope Private Access](https://www.netskope.com/products/private-access) product overview  and [Netskope Private Access](https://docs.netskope.com/en/netskope-private-access.html) documentation.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to automatically add or remove EC2 instances according to conditions you define. You can use the fleet management features of EC2 Auto Scaling to maintain the health and availability of your fleet. You can also use the dynamic and predictive scaling features of EC2 Auto Scaling to add or remove EC2 instances. Dynamic scaling responds to changing demand and predictive scaling automatically schedules the right number of EC2 instances based on predicted demand. Dynamic scaling and predictive scaling can be used together to scale faster. To learn more about Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling please refer to the [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/) documentation.

Deploying Netskope Private Publisher using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group allows you to dynamically respond to the users' traffic demand and to optimize cost of running your Netskope Private Access Publishers' EC2 instances.

## Overview

The solution consists of AWS CloudFormation template NPAPublisherAuto Scalling.yaml which deploys the following main resources:

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group of Netskope Private Publishers in your VPC. This Auto Scaling group has CPU-based Amazon EC2 [Dynamic Scaling Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scale-based-on-demand.html) with default CPU utilization target  75% which you can change during the deployment

- AWS Lambda function triggered automatically when new NPA Publisher EC2 instances are added or removed from the EC2 Auto Scaling group. This Lambda function calls [Netskope REST API v2](https://docs.netskope.com/en/rest-api-v2-overview-312207.html)  to provision and deprovision NPA Publisher in your Netskope tenant. It also identifies the [Netskope Private Applications](https://docs.netskope.com/en/private-app-management.html) that are using your Netskope Publisher EC2 Auto Scaling group and updates their configuration accordingly by removing or adding the specific publisher. The Netskope Private Applications naming convention required for this solution to function properly described in the next paragraph below

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling NPA Publisher Launching and Terminating Lifecycle Hooks to invoke the above Lambda function

- AWS Secrets Manager secret to store  Netskope REST API v2 access token. You can reuse the same AWS Secrets Manager Secret for multiple NPA Publisher Autos Scaling groups, providing the existing AWS Secrets Manager Secret ARN during the deployment, or choose to create a new AWS Secrets Manager Secret while deploying the solution. When choosing to use the existing Secret assure its resource-based policy allows *secretsmanager:GetSecretValue* and  *secretsmanager:DescribeSecret* actions to the NPACallNetskopeAPIv2LFRole Lambda Function IAM role created by this solution. For more details about AWS Secrets Manager security please refer to the user guide [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access.html)

- Custom resource AWS Lambda function to update your NPA Publisher Autoscaling group initial capacity during creation

- AWS IAM roles for the EC2 Instances in the Auto Scaling group. This role contains AWS-managed IAM policy AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore to allow EC2 instance management by the AWS Systems Manager. This is required to provision and deprovision NPA Publisher on your Netskope tenant. For more information about setting Amazon Systems Manager on your account please follow this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-sessions-start.html).

- AWS IAM roles for the NPA Publisher EC2 instances lifecycle management AWS Lambda function and for the custom resource AWS Lambda.

- NetskopeCETaskSecurityGroup will be used by the Netskope CE task


The solution also creates a NetskopeNPACustomResourceLF custom resource AWS Lambda function which is used to update your NPA Publisher Autoscaling group initial capacity.

This solution is a regional solution and can / may be deployed independently in multiple AWS regions. You can build a cross-region redundant NPA Publisher group following the same naming convention below.

## Naming convention

This solution requires a specific naming convention between the Netskope Private Access Publisher EC2 Auto Scaling group and the Netskope Private Applications using this Publishers' group.

Netskope Publishers in the same Publisher group serve all Private Apps assigned to it. When adding a new Publisher to the existing Publishers' group, this new Publisher gets added to all NPA Private Apps assigned to this Publishers' group. This is also true in our Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling setup - NPA Publishers EC2 Auto Scaling group is equivalent to the Netskope Publishers group. All Netskope Private Apps using this Publishers' group will automatically be reconfigured to include new Publishers added to the EC2 Auto Scaling group as well as to exclude Publishers removed from it.

This solution's AWS Lambda function identifies those Netskope Private Apps to be updated by using simple naming convention requiring a Private App name to **start with the NPA Publisher EC2 Auto Scaling Group name**. For example, if your NPA Publisher EC2 Auto Scaling Group name is MyNPAPublisherGroup1 , you can use any Private App name that starts with MyNPAPublisherGroup1 such as:

- MyNPAPublisherGroup1-App1
- MyNPAPublisherGroup1-WebServer
- MyNPAPublisherGroup1-Database-API

and so on.

This naming convention allows you to run multiple NPA Publishers EC2 Auto Scaling groups in the same AWS region or in the different AWS regions while still serving the same Netskope tenant. This also allows you to run multiple NPA Publishers EC2 Auto Scaling groups in one AWS region while serving different Netskope Private Apps in one Netskope tenant. The example on the diagram below illustrates the above

Congratulations! Your NPA Publisher EC2 Auto Scalling group deployment is complete.

## Test scaling

To test the Auto Scaling Group scaling you can use the stress utility to stress the publisher instances and trigger the Auto Scaling Group to add more instances. You can also use the AWS Console to manually change the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling Group and verify the publishers are being added and removed from the Private Apps.

## Clean up

To clean up the deployment you can delete the CloudFormation stack. This will delete all the resources created by the stack.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the deployment or operation of the solution, please check the CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function NPACallNetskopeAPIv2LF. The Lambda function logs all API calls to Netskope and any errors encountered during the execution.
